## Project Aeolus
Project Aeolus is an automous landing platform for high-altitude payloads. It allows your payloads to be guided to a desired landing site to be safely retreieved. The system uses an ATSAMD21 microcontroller running a high-speed control loop to control the descent of the craft. A parachute attached to stepper motors is used as the output actuator.
